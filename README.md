1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). 
2. Open the folder in powershell.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Then run `node app.js` in the same folder in powershell.
5. If all goes well, it should say 'Listening on localhost:8888' in your console. Now open up localhost:8888 in browser, sign in and grant access.
6. You can use the same link in OBS but make sure you're running the server first (by running the command `node app.js` in powershell).
